# Intro To Game Development

Welcome to my intro to game development repo! This repository contains a series of tutorials, exercises, and resources designed to help you start your journey in game development using [Unity](https://unity.com/).

## About This Series

In these tutorials, you'll learn how to:

- **Set Up Your Development Environment:** Download and install Unity, and get your tools ready.
- **Plan & Break Down Game Projects:** Learn strategies to design, plan, and manage your game projects effectively.
- **Understand Basic Programming Concepts:** Discover the fundamentals of programming within a game context using C#.
- **Work With Unity's Structure:** Get familiar with the Unity engine, its interface, and how to structure your code for game development.
- **Build Manageable, Finishable Projects:** Create projects that are small enough to complete, yet offer great learning opportunities.

While Unity is our primary focus for its beginner-friendly approach, we encourage you to explore other platforms like [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) once you've completed a few projects and feel comfortable with coding, and designing games.

## How to Get Started

1. **Read the Getting Started Guide:** Begin with [GettingStarted.md](GettingStarted.md) to set up your environment and understand the basics.
2. **Follow the Step-by-Step Tutorials:** Work through each tutorial at your own pace, applying what you learn along the way.
3. **Experiment and Build:** Use the exercises as a foundation to create your own mini-games and projects.

## Who Is This For?

- **Beginners:** No prior game development or programming experience is required.
- **Hobbyists:** Anyone with a passion for games and a desire to learn.
